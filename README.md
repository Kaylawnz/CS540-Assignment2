This is a lottery scheduling algorithm. It uses the random module by python.
There are two main classes the Process class and the scheduler class. 

The process class assigns a process a number which is where the lottery number gets assigned the amount of tickets.
The scheduler class goes through randomly and picks a lottery number and chooses the winner.

To run the program you can hard code the amount of processes you want. This is the lottery number and the amount of tickets you want to assign it.
Then you have to schedule the process to pick a lottery number.
Then use the winner selection definition from the scheduler class.
